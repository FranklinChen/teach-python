"""Lists can contain other lists, just as in real life a box can
contain other boxes. A very important concept in computing is the
tree. A Tree[A] of values of some type A is a dictionary with two
keys:

  - root: a root of type A
  - kids: a list of Tree[A] (called the children)

Note that a tree is defined recursively.
